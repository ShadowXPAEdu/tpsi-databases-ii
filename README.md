# Databases II

This subject focused on creating **PL/SQL** scripts to process data on the database servers.  
This subject was the continuation of the [first database subject](https://github.com/ShadowXPAEdu/tpsi-databases-i).

## Assignment

This subject had one assignment.

The [assignment](Assignment/Assignment.pdf) was to implement a database, with views, functions, procedures, and triggers to support a web system (fictional web system). This system allows users to analize the first, and second league of the portuguese football (soccer) championship. The assignment was done in teams of two. My partner was [@leandrofidalgo](https://github.com/leandrofidalgo).
